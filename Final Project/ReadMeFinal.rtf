\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is an app that uses api from openweathermap.org: fetches weather information of the city user enters and displays. Because it is a free api, it does not have a way to distinguish cities with the same name unless you have other information such as city id number or lang/lat data. There for entering \'93Auburn\'94 as city name won\'92t return the weather of Auburn in Alabama. Also, this free api does not specify way to fetch city\'92s weather with the city name that has a space in it (such as New York). If entered, it will throw an error. For the best result, it is best to test with the cities with unique name such as Seoul, Tokyo, etc. Weather icon and description will be displaying corresponding information on the app and temperature switch button will convert the temperature unit.}
